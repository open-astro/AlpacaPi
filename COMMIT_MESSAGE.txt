Add user agent logging system and remove JSON configuration

- Added comprehensive logging system for unknown user agents
  - New LogUnknownUserAgent() function logs unrecognized clients to logs/new_clients-YYYY-MM-DD-PORT.log
  - Implements deduplication to avoid logging the same user agent repeatedly
  - Added logs/README.md with complete documentation of logging system
  - Logs include timestamp, client IP, and user agent string for self-learning

- Removed JSON-based user agent mapping system
  - Removed LoadUserAgentMappings() and CheckUserAgentFromJSON() functions
  - Removed TYPE_UserAgentMapping struct and related data structures
  - Removed unused #include "json_parse.h" from alpacadriver.cpp
  - Deleted assets/user_agents.json and assets/README.md

- Consolidated user agent detection to hardcoded string comparisons
  - All client recognition now uses direct string matching
  - Added missing ASCOMAlpacaClient and SkySafari mappings to hardcoded detection
  - Simplified code flow by removing JSON parsing layer

- Fixed build error with thread status access
  - Added IsDriverThreadActive() public getter method to AlpacaDriver class
  - Updated alpacadriverThread.cpp to use getter instead of accessing protected member
